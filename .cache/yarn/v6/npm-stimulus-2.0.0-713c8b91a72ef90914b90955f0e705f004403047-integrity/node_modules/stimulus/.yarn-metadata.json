It doesn't seek to take over your entire front-end—in fact, it's not concerned with rendering HTML at all. Instead, it's designed to augment your HTML with just enough behavior to make it shine. Stimulus pairs beautifully with [Turbolinks](https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks) to provide a complete solution for fast, compelling applications with a minimal amount of effort.\n\nHow does it work? Sprinkle your HTML with controller, target, and action attributes:\n\n```html\n<div data-controller=\"hello\">\n  <input data-hello-target=\"name\" type=\"text\">\n\n  <button data-action=\"click->hello#greet\">Greet</button>\n\n  <span data-hello-target=\"output\"></span>\n</div>\n```\n\nThen write a compatible controller. Stimulus brings it to life automatically:\n\n```js\n// hello_controller.js\nimport { Controller } from \"stimulus\"\n\nexport default class extends Controller {\n  static targets = [ \"name\", \"output\" ]\n\n  greet() {\n    this.outputTarget.textContent =\n      `Hello, ${this.nameTarget.value}!`\n  }\n}\n```\n\nStimulus continuously watches the page, kicking in as soon as attributes appear or disappear. It works with any update to the DOM, regardless of whether it comes from a full page load, a Turbolinks page change, or an Ajax request. Stimulus manages the whole lifecycle.\n\nYou can write your first controller in five minutes by following along in the [Stimulus Handbook](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction).\n\nYou can read more about why we created this new framework in [The Origin of Stimulus](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/origin).\n\n## Installing Stimulus\n\nStimulus integrates with the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) asset packager to automatically load controller files from a folder in your app.\n\nYou can use Stimulus with other asset packaging systems, too. And if you prefer no build step at all, just drop a `<script>` tag on the page and get right down to business.\n\nSee the [Installation Guide](https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/installing) for detailed instructions.\n\n## Getting Help & Contributing Back\n\nLooking for the docs? Once you've read through the Handbook, consult the [Stimulus Reference](https://stimulusjs.org/reference/controllers) for API details.\n\nHave a question about Stimulus? Connect with other Stimulus developers on the [Stimulus Discourse](https://discourse.stimulusjs.org/) community forum.\n\nFind a bug? Head over to our [issue tracker](https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus/issues) and we'll do our best to help. We love pull requests, too!\n\nWe expect all Stimulus contributors to abide by the terms of our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).\n\n## Acknowledgments\n\nStimulus is [MIT-licensed](LICENSE.md) open-source software from [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/), the creators of [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org).\n\nContinuous integration is generously provided by open-source grants from [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) and [Sauce Labs](https://saucelabs.com/open-source).\n\n---\n\n© 2020 Basecamp, LLC.\n",
